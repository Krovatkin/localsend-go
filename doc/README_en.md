Currently divided into version v1.1.0 and v1.2.0. For version v1.1.0 documentation, see [Localsend-Go-Version-1.1.0 doc](version1.1.0/).

The following documentation is for version v1.2.0.

## Installation

### Arch Linux

```bash
yay -Syy
yay -S localsend-go
```

> ðŸ˜Š Alternatively, download the executable file from the Release section. Find the one for your platform.

### Prerequisites

- [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) 1.16 or later

### Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/meowrain/localsend_cli.git
cd localsend_cli
```

### Build

Use the `Makefile` to build the program.

```sh
make build
```

This will generate binaries for all supported platforms and store them in the `bin` directory.

## Usage

Or run:

```sh
.\localsend_cli-windows-amd64.exe
```

![Version 1.2](images/v1.2.png)

Simply use the keyboard to select the desired mode, and the corresponding mode will automatically start.

> In Receive Mode, please use `Ctrl + C` to exit the program after receiving files. Do not close the window directly; on Windows, closing the window does not terminate the program.

Run the appropriate binary for your OS and architecture.
